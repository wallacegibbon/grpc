%% @doc This cowboy stream handler takes care of flow control.
%%
%% It keeps track of the number of bytes received on a stream
%% and sends a {flow, ...} command when this reaches a certain threshold, so
%% that the stream and connection windows are adjusted (Cowboy will send
%% two WINDOW_UPDATE frames to the client, one for the stream and one for the
%% connection).
%%
%% The goal is to send the updates in such a way that the traffic will
%% never be stalled, but at the same time limiting the number of WINDOW_UPDATE
%% frames. Since this implementation has no knowledge of the specifics of the
%% stream, it must take a very general approach. The chosen approach is to
%% "top up" the window to its original size (65535 bytes) as soon as it is
%% 50% depleted.
